- Recognizing faces of 40 people from 400 images each containing 1024 pixels.
- Built a multi-class classification model by splitting the given data into training and testing sets.
- Trained the linear model by minimizing the 𝐿2-regularised sum of the squares loss and applied a k-fold crossvalidation approach.
- Visualizing a face from the true left side of a picture and a predicted right part of the face.
